This blog is powered by [JustWriting](https://github.com/hjue/JustWriting).
It looks beautiful and the posts are all markdown text files, which makes
my blogging experience simple. To the creators of JustWriting: thank you for this open source blogging system.

Every serious programmer I've ran into on the internet has some sort of online presence, and many have a personal blog. I guess I just got inspired. I find computers very exciting, and sometimes I just want
to share some of that excitement with you.
